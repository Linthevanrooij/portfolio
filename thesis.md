<h3>Escaping the Room, Not the Bias: Investigating the False Consensus Effect through Experiential and Observational Learning in an Educational Escape Room.</h3>

For my thesis project, I created a custum-build escape room to investigate the False Consensus Effect, a cognitive bias where people overestimate how much others share their opinions and beliefs. The whole project was actually a perfect combination of the psychology part of my previous bachelor Psychobiology and the skills and knowledge that I gained during my master's Creative Intelligence & Technology. Although the whole foundation surrounding the False Consensus Effect and learning experiences was more Social-Science focused, the process of building a whole escape room from scrath (including assembling a micro-controlled second-hand telephone) would not have been possible without everything that I learned during my masters CRIT.

The (portable) escape room was aimed to create an active learning experience about the underlying arguments surrounding the statement *Should AI replace office workers?* An impression of the design and elements present in the escape room can be found below.
