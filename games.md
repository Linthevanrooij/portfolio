The game of the Goose is a typical Dutch board game in which you have to be the first to reach the
last tile of the board by throwing with a dice. In between the first and the last tiles, there are multiple
tiles corresponding to an action, such as a “bridge” or a “prison”. 

As part of the course Hardware & Physical Computing, me and two other classmates created a larger ‘real life’ version of this board game to play with real people (our classmates) as pawns, supported by LED strips and sound effect functioning as the normal gooses. The interactive game was received as very enjoyable and dynamic!
