Hello & a warm welcome to my portfolio page! 

Curious to check out some of the projects I made during my masters Creative Intelligence & Technology? Don't wait any longer and go directly to my projects page. 

**Creative Intelligence & Technology? What are you talking about!?**

Creative Intelligence & Technology (CRIT), formerly called Media Technology, is a masters program that stimulates a playful and creative approach to research. It allowed me to explore my creativity in executing research, while teaching me all the necessary skills for creating the back-end and front-end of tech-related projects. My projects ranged from games and digitial tools to physical installations, one of which got selected for an exhibition in Leiden! But it did not end there, one of my projects that compared the problem solving skills of AI and humans is published in a journal! 

Cuaght your interest now? Explore some of the projects, or jump directly to my cherry on top: [my graduation thesis](/portfolio/thesis.html), where I explored the effects of different learning paradigms on reducing the False Consensus Effect with a *custom-built escape room*!
