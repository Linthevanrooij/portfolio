Hello & a warm welcome to my portfolio page! 

Curious to check out some of the projects I made during my masters Creative Intelligence & Technology? Don't wait any longer and go directly to my [projects page](/portfolio/projects.html). 

**Creative Intelligence & Technology? What are you talking about!?**

Creative Intelligence & Technology (CRIT), formerly called Media Technology, is a masters program that stimulates a playful and creative approach to research. It allowed me to explore my creativity in executing research, while teaching me all the necessary skills for creating the back-end and front-end of tech-related projects. My projects ranged from games and digitial tools to physical installations, one of which (Neurosonification) got selected for [an exhibition in Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2024/06/unique-exhibition-translates-science-into-music-images-and-dance)! But it did not end there, The Riddle Experiment, a research project that compared the problem solving skills of AI and humans in Black Stories is even published [in a journal](https://www.clinjournal.org/clinj/article/view/212)!

Caught your interest now? Explore some of my cool projects, or jump directly to the cherry on top: [my graduation thesis](/portfolio/thesis.html), where I explored the effects of different learning paradigms on reducing the False Consensus Effect with a *custom-built escape room*!
