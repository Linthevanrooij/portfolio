<h3>PianoSheetAI</h3>

As part of the course HCI, me and Emma Boom built an interactive web application, that, with the help of AI, translated user input into a workable score for piano musicians! With two cycles of prototyping and testing, we finalized the tool as a pianosheet generator for musicians with a creative block. With our presentation, we received the "best presentation award"!

Later, for the course Computational Creativity, we further developed this tool into PianoSheetAI 2.0 focused on co-creativity.
