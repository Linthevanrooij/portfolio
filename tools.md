As part of the course HCI, me and Emma Boom built an interactive web application, that, with the help of AI, translated user input into a workable score for piano musicians! With two cycles of prototyping and testing, we finalized the tool as a pianosheet generator for musicians with a creative block. With our presentation, we received the "best presentation award"!


Later, for the course Computational Creativity, we further developed this tool into PianoSheetAI 2.0 focused on co-creativity.

The Creative Programming Course taught me how to program in Processing, a java-based programming tool. I created a creative tool that turns any image into a colouring template, inspired by “paint by number”. A paint-by-number painting is a painting in the form of a colouring plate with tiny numbers in it, defining which colour needs to be painted where. This is something that became a famous activity during COVID-19 and is a personal hobby of mine as well. This creative tool turns any image into a printable colouring template and defines colours to paint inside the tool as well.

One of my elective projects was AI in Society. For the final project, we had to re-imagine what AI could be in a hopeful way within a specific domain. I chose "Environment" and build a concept idea/ prototype for a tool that tracks your GPT usage, and links this to energy and water usage, based on known data.
