**About me**  

Hi there! 

I am Linthe van Rooij, currently working on my graduation project from Creative Intelligence and Technology (CIaT)

Check out some of the projects I made during my Masters CIaT, a masters that allowed me to create a foundation in technology and mix this with my artistic side. What does this mean? This means that I am specialized in making projects, experiences and installations which convey information about a certain subject.
